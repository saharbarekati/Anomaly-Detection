# Anomaly-Detection
in this Project we use GAN and the main goal is finding the abnormal EEG records photos between the datasets.
At first we have 5- dimensional photos in our data sets that we drop the 2 first dimensionals. Our dataset has 3 channel RGB. AUC & ROC graphs shows that how a classifier do its best. Moreover, precision recall curve graphs shows how the classifire run in different thresholds.
